Review of Pentester academy CRTP certification

I recently attempted and cleared Pentester academy CRTP certification. 
Following are some points and information that might be useful for attemting this certification and exam:

1: If you do not have any knowledege about Active directory and powershell, consider taking 60 days of LABS.

2: If you have prior knowledge of Active directory and powershell, 30 days of labs are enough.

3: Lab videos along with video walkthrough are sufficient to attempt the certification exam.

4: While practicing labs, focus more on domnain enumeration. Explore this area more.

5: Learn more on Powerview, PowerUPSQL capabilties and options.

6: Bloodhound knowledege would be useful, learn to correlate tool information with bloodhound information.

7: Defense video should be looked at atleast once.

8: Take a backup of all the tools present in the lab machine onto your local laptop.
